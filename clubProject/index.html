                        <p dir="ltr"><span>Having a hard time finding an existing student organization that fits your needs? Start your own! All you need is four other people who are matriculated CSUWB students with a GPA of 2.0 or better and a staff or faculty member employed by the university who has agreed to be your On-Campus Advisor. Below are the five easy steps to completing this process.&nbsp;</span></p><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li dir="ltr">
                                <strong>Create the Club/Organization's Portal</strong><br>Login with your ID and password and register a new organization. You will need your club/organization's information, including a constitution, roster, information on your (minimum of) five officers (name, ID, horizon email, and phone number), and the name, position, and CSUWB email address of an On-Campus Advisor who's agreed to serve in that role.
                            </li>
                            <li dir="ltr">
                                <strong>Complete the Recognition &amp; Renewal Officer Training Forms</strong><br>Once you submit the Club/Organization Registration Form, each of your officers will automatically be sent the Recognition &amp; Renewal Officer Training Form. A minimum of five individual submissions, one by each officer, must fully be completed. The form will be tied to each officer's account, so it is crucial that horizon email addresses are entered accurately in the Club/Organization Registration Form. Our recommendation is to allocate at least one hour to complete this online training.
                            </li>
                            <li dir="ltr">
                                <strong>Complete the On-Campus Advisor Form</strong><br>Every club/organization must have a CSUWB staff or faculty member that serves as the On-Campus Advisor. The On-Campus Advisor must also complete and submit their form to accept the responsibility of guiding your organization.&nbsp;The On-Campus Advisor Form will automatically be sent to the email address you provide on the Club/Organization Registration Form.</li>
                            <li dir="ltr">
                                <strong>Meet with Your Student Life Advisor<br></strong>Upon completing the previous three steps, your assigned Student Life Advisor (a Student Life and Leadership Programs staff member) will reach out to you to set up a meeting. During this meeting, you will discuss the goals of your club/organization, provide different sources of support available to you, and review any questions you may have about the process, training, or policies.</li>

                                <strong>Attend the Fall Leadership Conference</strong><br>Attendance at the Fall Leadership Conference is required for all officers. We highly encourage ALL of your club/organization members to attend these important leadership opportunities as well.
                            </li>
